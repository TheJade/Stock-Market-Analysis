# Stock-Market-Analysis

I just did some practice with data analysis. 

I used Jupyter Notebooks to program visualize the fast fourier transform of some historical stock prices. 

I tried using different stocks to see if there was any signifigant result.

As expected the process was pointless. No signifigant trends were found.
